This hyperfunction family follows the two-step aggregation pattern.
This differs from the more commonly seen one-step aggregation pattern,
making it easier to work with window functions and continuous aggregates.

<p>
In a one-step aggregation, you apply a single function to a set of rows to get a final result.
For example, the single PostgreSQL function <code>AVG</code> directly calculates the average.
</p>

<p>
In a two-step aggregation, you apply two separate functions to get a final result:
<ol>
<li>The aggregate function, which aggregates a set of rows into an intermediate form</li>
<li>An accessor function, which operates on the intermediate form to produce the final result</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
One aggregate can have multiple accessors.
Different accessors use the same intermediate form to produce different final results,
such as average and standard deviation.
</p>

The two-step aggregation pattern can improve performance.
It also makes it easier to reason about your code when you perform aggregations on top of aggregations.
