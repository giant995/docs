  Calculate the determination coefficient from the values in a statistical
  aggregate.
  The calculation uses linear least-squares regression.

      Calculate the determination coefficient of independent variable `y` and
      dependent variable `x` for each 15-minute time bucket.
    command:
      language: sql
      code: |-
        SELECT
            id,
            time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
            determination_coeff(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
        FROM foo
        GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
