summary: >-
  Calculate the covariance from the values in a statistical
  aggregate.
  The calculation uses linear least-squares regression.
signatures:
  - language: sql
    code: |-
      covariance(
          summary StatsSummary2D,
          method TEXT
      ) RETURNS DOUBLE PRECISION
parameters:
  required:
    - name: summary
      type: StatsSummary2D
      description: >-
        The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call
  optional:
    - name: method
      type: TEXT
      description: >-
        The method used for calculating the covariance. The two options are
        `population` and `sample`, which can be abbreviated to `pop` or `samp`.
        Defaults to `sample`.
  returns:
    - column: covariance
      type: DOUBLE PRECISION
      description: >-
        The covariance of the least-squares fit line
examples:
  - description: >-
      Calculate the covariance of independent variable `y` and
      dependent variable `x` for each 15-minute time bucket.
    input:
      - language: sql
        code: |-
          SELECT
              id,
              time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
              covariance(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
          FROM foo
          GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
