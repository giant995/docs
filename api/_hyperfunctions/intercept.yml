  Calculate the y intercept from the values in a statistical aggregate.
  The calculation uses linear least-squares regression.

      description: >-
        The statistical aggregate produced by a `stats_agg` call
  returns:
    - column: intercept
      type: DOUBLE PRECISION
      description: >-
        The y intercept of the least-squares fit line
examples:
  - description: >-
      Calculate the y intercept from independent variable `y` and dependent
      variable `x` for each 15-minute time bucket.

      code: |-
        SELECT
            id,
            time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts) AS bucket,
            intercept(stats_agg(y, x)) AS summary
        FROM foo
        GROUP BY id, time_bucket('15 min'::interval, ts)
